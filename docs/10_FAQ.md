+ *Does the workflow calls 5hmC, on top of 5mC?* - Yes, the workflow does call 5hmC, but only if you performed the basecalling with the appropriate module; for more details, check out the [dorado github page](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado#dna-models).

+ *Can I run the workflow in tumor-only mode?* - Currently, the workflow can run only with matching tumor/normal BAM files for the same sample.
